# ShortURL Generator

Welcome to ShortURL Generator, a simple application for creating shortcuts for your URLs.

## Synopsis

This project was carried out as part of our training at [l'École Supérieure du Digital](https://ecole-du-digital.com/) in Bordeaux. It is an API project, and our goal was to create an API in a group of two people. We chose to develop an API for creating shortened URLs.

Why did we choose this project? We are working in a company during our apprenticeship, and we often need to create shortened URLs. So, we decided to create an API that would allow us to generate shortened URLs, which we could use in our company.

## Authors

[Théo Gillet](https://github.com/theo-code33) and [Louis Bouet](https://github.com/1ouiss) completed this project in one week.

## Features
